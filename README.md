This repository demonstrates a common Ada programming error: incorrect array indexing that leads to a `Constraint_Error`. The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.ada` file provides the corrected version.  The error arises from using an array element as an index into the same array without proper bounds checking.  This can easily happen in nested loops or when manipulating array indices dynamically.  The solution emphasizes the importance of careful indexing and ensuring that indices remain within the valid range of the array.
